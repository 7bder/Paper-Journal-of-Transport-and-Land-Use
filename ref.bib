We find significant differences in corruption across these occupations and factors driving overall corrupt activity, including personal attributes of bribe givers, macroeconomic and institutional factors, and these factors do not necessarily exert similar influences across all government occupations. In particular, police corruption seems qualitatively different from corruption in other occupations.},

We subdivided the state of Maryland, USA into 1151 Statewide Modeling Zones and developed a set of variables for the base year (2000). We estimated multiple models of transit ridership - using ordinary least squares and spatial error modeling approaches - for the entire state. We also test for the determinants of ridership within urban, suburban and rural typologies. We find that land use type, transit accessibility, income, and density are strongly significant and robust predictors of transit ridership for the statewide and urban areas datasets. We also find that the determinants and their coefficients vary across urban, suburban and rural areas. Next we used a suite of econometric, land use and other models to generate two sets of future transit ridership scenarios under conditions of - (a) business as usual and (b) high energy price - for a 30-year horizon. We analyze these scenarios to demonstrate the value of our approach for state-level decision-making. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study is an investigation into the factors affecting Metro demand at a station level. These factors were examined in the Seoul metropolitan area, which is one of the most densely populated regions in the world. A regression analysis was conducted with weekly average of station boardings as the dependent variable. Twenty-four independent variables were chosen based on insights and findings from previous studies. They were categorized into three groups: built environment, external connectivity, and intermodal connection. Seven variables proved to be significantly associated with station boardings: employment, commercial floor area, office floor area, net population density, number of transfers, number of feeder bus lines, and a dummy variable indicating transfer stations. Furthermore, in order to identify indirect or cyclic relationships among variables in generating station boardings, which cannot be accounted for in regression analysis, a structural equation model (SEM) was adopted. Prior to the model identification, a conceptual framework was hypothesized. After testing a number of candidate SEMs within the framework, the final SEM was established. All links in the final model were statistically significant. Several links represented cyclic relationships between variables. As a result, some variables that were insignificant in the regression analysis were included in the final SEM. Variables in the external connectivity group were found to be associated with station boardings, and variables for land use and walkability proved to be indirectly related to station boardings through employment. In particular, the number of feeder bus lines was found to have a reciprocal relationship with station boardings. Several separate links represented a cyclic relationship between external connectivity and intermodal connection. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This report presents the development of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models for predicting public transit use for home-based work trip purpose. A large array of potential transit use predictors were considered, including demographic, socioeconomic, land use, transit supply quality, and pedestrian environment variables. The best predictors identified through model estimation include two global variables, regional accessibility to employment and percentage of households with no car, and three local variables, employment density, average number of cars in households with children, and percentage of Black population. The models were estimated based on 2000 CTPP data for Broward County. Model testing showed significant improvement in model accuracy. The GWR models indicate that for local variables, their significance and influence vary by location. It is also observed that for this particular problem, an unexpected local sign of a variable is an indication of the insignificance or irrelevance of the variable at that location. This understanding of where a variable is significant and how significant it is at different locations is useful because it provides a basis for the development of transit service improvements by determining where improvements are needed and how much benefit the improvements will bring. The findings indicate that the local model estimation technique of GWR can help improve transit demand analysis and the identification of priority areas where transit service may need improvements.},

abstract = {Public subsidy of transit services has increased dramatically in recent years, with little effect on overall ridership. Quite obviously, a clear understanding of the factors influencing transit ridership is central to decisions on investments in and the pricing and deployment of transit services. Yet the literature about the causes of transit use is quite spotty; most previous aggregate analyses of transit ridership have examined just one or a few systems, have not included many of the external, control variables thought to influence transit use, and have not addressed the simultaneous relationship between transit service supply and consumption. This study addresses each of these shortcomings by (1) conducting a cross-sectional analysis of transit use in 265 US urbanized areas, (2) testing dozens of variables measuring regional geography, metropolitan economy, population characteristics, auto/highway system characteristics, and transit system characteristics, and (3) constructing two-stage simultaneous equation regression models to account for simultaneity between transit service supply and consumption. We find that most of the variation in transit ridership among urbanized areas - in both absolute and relative terms - can be explained by factors outside of the control of public transit systems: (1) regional geography (specifically, area of urbanization, population, population density, and regional location in the US), (2) metropolitan economy (specifically, personal/household income), (3) population characteristics (specifically, the percent college students, recent immigrants, and Democratic voters in the population), and (4) auto/highway system characteristics (specifically, the percent carless households and non-transit/non-SOV trips, including commuting via carpools, walking, biking, etc.). While these external factors clearly go a long way toward determining the overall level of transit use in an urbanized area, we find that transit policies do make a significant difference. The observed range in both fares and service frequency in our sample could account for at least a doubling (or halving) of transit use in a given urbanized area. Controlling for the fact that public transit use is strongly correlated with urbanized area size, about 26{\%} of the observed variance in per capita transit patronage across US urbanized areas is explained in the models presented here by service frequency and fare levels. The observed influence of these two factors is consistent with both the literature and intuition: frequent service draws passengers, and high fares drive them away. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study has dual research objectives: 1) to evaluate the land use characteristics of the pedestrian catchment areas (PCA) of subway stations in the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA) in terms of transit-oriented development (TOD) principles and 2) to investigate the influence of each PCA's land use characteristics on station-level ridership. The major findings can be summarized as follows. First, the built environments of subway PCAs in Seoul were found to be compatible with TOD principles in terms of density and diversity. They have declining density gradients of population and employment that extend outward from a station and have a high level of mixed-use land.Second, population and employment densities, land use mix diversity, and intermodal connectivity all have a positive impact on subway ridership, but differ in their spatial ranges. In particular, the influence spans of residential and commercial development patterns (population density and the proportion of commercial land) and mixed land use on ridership were limited to only the core and primary PCAs. Consequently, with respect to TOD in a compact city like Seoul, we recommend that a PCA be defined to encompass a radius of 600 m.},

abstract = {Many US cities have recently built or approved light-rail systems to combat congestion, sprawl, and pollution. Critics questions light rail's ability to generate ridership in low-density, automobile-oriented, polycentric US cities with smaller downtowns. Proponents counter that sufficient numbers of homes and workplaces have convenient access to stations via walking, park-and-ride, or bus to develop feasible corridors connecting major residential areas with suburban concentrations of employment and the CBD. With this in mind, we used multiple regression to determine factors that contribute to higher light-rail ridership. Cross-sectional data on average weekday boardings were collected for the year 2000 for 268 stations in nine US cities representing a variety of urban settings. The results showed the importance of land use and accessibility. Employment, population, and percent renters within walking distance, as well as bus lines, park-and-ride spaces, and centrality, were significant. Dummy variables for terminal and transfer stations and international borders were all positive and significant. Total degree-days were negative and significant, lowering expectations for cities with extreme climates. Notably, the stations in the CBD generate much higher boardings, but these are explainable by the same variables present in lesser combinations at non-CBD stations and account for their generally lesser boardings. Importantly, a dummy variable for CBD location was not significant. The resulting model may be useful as a first-cut, one-step approach for predicting demand for possible light-rail alignments. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A growing base of research adopts direct demand models to reveal associations between transit ridership and influence factors in recent years. This study is designed to investigate the factors affecting rail transit ridership at both station level and station-to-station level by adopting multiple regression model and multiplicative model respectively, specifically using an implemented Metro system in Nanjing, China, where Metro implementation is on the rise. Independent variables include factors measuring land-use mix, intermodal connection, station context, and travel impedance. Multiple regression model proves 11 variables are significantly associated with Metro ridership at station level: population, employment, business/office floor area, CBD dummy variable, number of major educational sites, entertainment venues and shopping centers, road length, feeder bus lines, bicycle park-and-ride (P{\&}R) spaces, and transfer dummy variable. Results from multiplicative model indicate that factors influencing Metro station ridership may also influence Metro station-to-station ridership, varied by both trip ends (origin/destination) and time of day. In comparison with previous case studies, CBD dummy variable and bicycle P{\&}R are statistically significant to explain Metro ridership in Nanjing. In addition, Metro travel impedance variables have significant influence on station-to-station ridership, representing the basic time-decay relationship in travel distribution. Potential implications of the model results include estimating Metro ridership at station level and station-to-station level by considering the significant variables, recognizing the necessity to establish a cooperative multi-modal transit system, and identifying opportunities for transit-oriented development. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {While most aggregate studies of transit ridership are conducted at either the stop or the route level, the present study focused on factors affecting Metro ridership in the Seoul metropolitan area at the station-to-station level. The station-to-station analysis made it possible to distinguish the effect of origin factors on Metro ridership from that of destination factors and to cut down the errors caused by the aggregation of travel impedance-related variables. After adopting two types of direct-demand patronage forecasting models, the multiplicative model and the Poisson regression model, the former was found to be superior to the latter because it clearly identified the negative influences of competing modes on Metro ridership. Such results are rarely found with aggregate level analyses. Moreover, the importance of built environment in explaining Metro demand was confirmed by separating built environment variables for origin and destination stations and by differentiating ridership by the time of day. For morning peak hours, the population-related variables of the origin stations played a key role in accounting for Metro ridership, while employment-related variables prevailed in destination stations. In evening peak hours, both employment- and population-related variables were significant in accounting for the Metro ridership at the destination station. This showed that a significant number of people in the Seoul metropolitan area appear to take various non-home-based trips after work, which is consistent with the results from direct household travel surveys. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

For each issue, the discussion focuses on the alternative approaches to dealing with the issue, any resolution, and CUTR's recommendation, if different from the resolution. The second part discusses the data made available by Kittelson and Associates, Inc. under a separate contract with the FDOT, the data used for model estimation, and the selection of a final model. The final model relates average weekday boarding at a TLOS stop with six categories of factors: 1) socio-demographics in a catchment area; 2) TLOS value; 3) the street environment for pedestrians; 4) accessibility to population and employment; 5) interaction with other modes; and 6) competition with other TLOS stops. Despite some data limitations, the model fits the data well and behaves as expected.},

These models estimate the number of passengers boarding at each station as a function of the station characteristics and the areas that they serve. These models have considerable advantages over the traditional four-step model, including simplicity of use, easy interpretation of results, immediate response and low cost. Nevertheless, the models usually use traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression, which assume parametric stability. This study proposes a direct model that uses geographically weighted regression (GWR) to forecast boarding at the Madrid Metro stations. Here, the results obtained using the OLS and GWR models are compared. The GWR model results in a better fit than the traditional one. In addition, the information supplied by the GWR model regarding the spatial variation of elasticities and their statistical significance provides more realistic and useful results. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This article develops a rapid response ridership forecast model, based on the combined use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), distance-decay functions and multiple regression models. The number of passengers boarding at each station in the Madrid Metro network is estimated as a function of the characteristics of the stations (type, number of lines, accessibility within the network, etc.) and of the areas they serve (population and employment characteristics, land-use mix, street density, presence of feeder modes, etc.). The paper considers the need to evaluate the distance threshold used (not the choice of a fixed distance threshold by assimilation from other studies), the distance calculation procedure (network distance versus straight-line distance) and, above all, the use of distance-decay weighted regression (so that the data from the bands nearer the stations have a greater weighting in the model than those farther away). Analyses carried out show that weighting the variables according to the distance-decay functions provides systematically better results. The choice of distance threshold also significantly improves outcomes. When an all-or-nothing function is used, the way the service area is calculated (straight-line or network distances) does not seem to have a decisive influence on the results. However, it seems to be more influential when distance-decay weighting is used. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Shortcomings of previous research:
1. Proposed models use standard distance thresholds for delimiting service areas and do not take into account that the greater the distance to stops and stations within the catchment area, the less public transport tends to be used.

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to analyze the relationship between the ridership of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway (SMS) and the land-use pattern of its station areas to verify the assumption that the ridership of transit stations at both ends of the range of urban structural hierarchy is more affected by density than by land use diversity, whereas the ridership of the stations in between are influenced more by land use diversity than by density. The station areas were classified and clustered according to an accessibility index, which refers to the position of the urban structural hierarchy of Seoul. A multiple regression model was applied to each cluster of the station areas. Finally, the estimated models for all station areas and for the clusters were compared to verify the assumption. The results show that the subway ridership at Seoul's CBD and fringe areas is primarily influenced by density, whereas the sub-central area is generally affected by diversity. The intermodal connectivity by bus had an influence. The results provide policy implications for Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) strategies to increase subway ridership in metropolitan areas where a number of sub-centers exist. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study aims to explore public perception of paratransit service, as represented by the user and non-user of paratransit. The analysis has been conducted based on the public{\^{a}}s response, by creating several binomial logistic regression models using the public perception of the quality of service, quality of car, quality of driver, and fare. These models illustrate the characteristics and important variables to establish whether the public will use more paratransit in the future once improvements will have been made. Moreover, several models are developed to explore public perception in order to find out whether they agree to the replacement of paratransit with other types of transportation modes. All models are well fitting. These models are able to explain the respondents{\^{a}} characteristics and to reveal their actual perception of the operation of paratransit.

The model is estimated at the route-segment level by time of day and direction. The results show strong simultaneity among transit demand, supply and competing routes. Transit ridership is affected by the level of service, which in turn is determined by current demand and ridership in the previous year. The model demonstrates that a service improvement has a twofold impact on ridership; it increases ridership on the route with service changes, but it also reduces the ridership on competing routes so that the net ridership change is small. The model is thus useful for both system-level analysis and route-level service planning.},

abstract = {Background Obesity is a major health problem in the United States and around the world. To date, relationships between obesity and aspects of the built environment have not been evaluated empirically at the individual level. Objective To evaluate the relationship between the built environment around each participant's place of residence and self-reported travel patterns (walking and time in a car), body mass index (BMI), and obesity for specific gender and ethnicity classifications. Methods Body Mass Index, minutes spent in a car, kilometers walked, age, income, educational attainment, and gender were derived through a travel survey of 10,878 participants in the Atlanta, Georgia region. Objective measures of land use mix, net residential density, and street connectivity were developed within a 1-kilometer network distance of each participant's place of residence. A cross-sectional design was used to associate urban form measures with obesity, BMI, and transportation-related activity when adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Discrete analyses were conducted across gender and ethnicity. The data were collected between 2000 and 2002 and analysis was conducted in 2004. Results Land-use mix had the strongest association with obesity (BMI???30 kg/m2), with each quartile increase being associated with a 12.2{\%} reduction in the likelihood of obesity across gender and ethnicity. Each additional hour spent in a car per day was associated with a 6{\%} increase in the likelihood of obesity. Conversely, each additional kilometer walked per day was associated with a 4.8{\%} reduction in the likelihood of obesity. As a continuous measure, BMI was significantly associated with urban form for white cohorts. Relationships among urban form, walk distance, and time in a car were stronger among white than black cohorts. Conclusions Measures of the built environment and travel patterns are important predictors of obesity across gender and ethnicity, yet relationships among the built environment, travel patterns, and weight may vary across gender and ethnicity. Strategies to increase land-use mix and distance walked while reducing time in a car can be effective as health interventions. ?? 2004 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

@article{Cervero1997,
abstract = {The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along three principal dimensions —density, diversity, and design. This paper tests this proposition by examining how the ‘3Ds' affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing ‘walking quality' was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel.},
